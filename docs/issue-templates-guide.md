2. Click "New Issue"

4. Fill out the form (required fields are marked)
5. Click "Submit new issue"
6. A Copilot coding agent can be assigned to implement your request!

## What Makes These Templates Copilot-Ready?

Each template includes:
- **Clear problem description** - Forms guide you to explain what's needed
- **Clear acceptance criteria** - Defines what "done" looks like
- **Technical hints** - Gives the coding agent starting points
- **Context and limitations** - Provides important background information

This means teachers can fill out a simple form, and a Copilot coding agent will have everything needed to implement the change without asking follow-up questions!
